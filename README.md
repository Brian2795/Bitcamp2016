# Bitcamp2016

Represented market trends acoustically through Matlab.
Used libraries to pull stock data from Yahoo's API and do a Guppy Multiple Moving Average analysis of select stocks. The trend data from these stocks were then scaled and manipulated to translate over to a pitch shift in the song chosen by the users. The echo of the song was also modified based on the number of crossovers between the long and short term moving averages during a set period of time. By compounding the echos, the application could acoustically portray the instability in a select stock as well. The user interface was built through Matlab's App Designeer. Our team of two were runner-up contestants in MathWork's challenge.
